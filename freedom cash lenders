Before committing to no-income loans—which often come with high interest rates, short repayment periods, and the risk of falling into debt—it’s worth exploring other options that might be more affordable and less risky.

Homeowners may be able to borrow against home equity. These options typically offer lower interest rates than no-income personal loans as they’re secured by your home. However, missing payments can result in foreclosure, making this a risky option if you’re unsure about repayment.
